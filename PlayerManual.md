In this little game you play as a bee whos whole colony has been destroyed by a group of different bugs.
All the bugs you fight in the game are natural predators to bees.
You are meant to explore as far as you can into the hive, enemies and rewards scale with how each floor of the hive that you get past.
There are five types of rooms, enemy rooms, which are meant to generate the most frequently, trap rooms, which will debuff your character, 
item rooms, which give you an item for free, a shop, each is run by a moth who will accept nectar (the game's currency) in exchange for equipment or a place to rest,
and exit rooms, only one will generate per floor, it always takes you to the next level of the hive.
There's also a subtype of enemy rooms called boss rooms, which only generate once per floor.
The bug there gets strong much faster than any of the other bugs and can one shot you on later floors if you try to run away.
For enemies and traps, there is always the option to try to avoid them, enemies will always get a hit on you
while traps have a chance of triggring based on what stat is associated. 
Also early on pretty much unless you get a sword immediately, mantises will kill you very quickly, so avoid them.
The game is a work in progress that I'd like to revisit and make a proper ui for at some point, this is just so I have something to turn in for class.
